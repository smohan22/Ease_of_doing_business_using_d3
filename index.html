  <p>The <a href="http://www.doingbusiness.org/">World Bank</a> measures business regulations for local firm in 190 economies around the world. It measures what regulations enhances business activity and what contraints it.

  <p>Doing Business presents quantitative indicators on business regulations and the protection of property rights that can be compared across 190 economies—from Afghanistan to Zimbabwe—and over time.

  *Important Definition:* An economy's distance to frontier is reflected on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the lowest performance and 100 represents the frontier. For example, a score of 75 in DB 2016 means an economy was 25 percentage points away from the frontier constructed from the best performances across all economies and across time.
